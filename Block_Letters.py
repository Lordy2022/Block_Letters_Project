# 1) What is your name, then we can determine your initials: 

# My name is Kyle Lord.

# 2) Give us an interesting fact about yourself!: 

# Most people find it quite interesting, that I have a twin sister.

# 3) For your first Python project, print your name in block letters below:

print("K   K  L     ")  
print("K  K   L     ")
print("K K    L     ")
print("KK     L     ")
print("K K    L     ")
print("K  K   L     ")
